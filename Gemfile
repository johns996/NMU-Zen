# A sample Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

## not using breakpoing any more since it is a dependency nightmare
## old version has no documentation
## new version require undocumented compass version
## new compass version does not appear to be comptable with zen
 

## these old versions of breakpoint/compass/sass will work just fine if needed
## must be run through bundler: bundle exec compass compile
#gem 'breakpoint', '~>1.3'
#gem 'compass', '~>0.12.6'
#gem 'sass', '~>3.2.19'

## these latest gemfiles are not fully compatabile with zen
#gem 'breakpoint', '~>2.5.0'
gem 'compass', '1.0.1'
gem 'sass', '3.4.6'
